# Planet Simulator
The project consist purely of header files for performing 3D planet projectile
calculations. The source code currently have no dependencies.

## Implemented Stepping Methods
- Euler method.
- Heun's method.
- Runge-Kutta method.

## Runge Kutta Example

## Further Notes
The code is not currenly implemented to be fast or memory efficient.
Maybe something to fix in the future.
